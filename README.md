# 3D to Pixel Art Spritesheet Converter

🎨 Passionate about pixel art and development, I'm thrilled to introduce my latest project – a powerful tool that seamlessly converts 3D models into pixel art spritesheets! 🚀

## Overview

Over the past few weeks, I've poured my creativity into developing a tool that holds a special place in my creative toolkit. This innovative solution allows for the efficient transformation of any 3D model into a spritesheet, providing a fresh perspective on pixel art asset production. 🖼️✨

## Key Features

### 1. Versatility

What sets this tool apart is its unparalleled versatility. It supports three different textures: albedo, normal, and UV. This unique feature not only showcases my dedication to improving skills in UnityEditor tool development but also opens up new creative possibilities by exploring various nuances in pixel art creation. 💡🔍

### 2. Texture Support

- **Albedo Texture:** Capture the base color of your 3D model.
- **Normal Texture:** Retain the surface normals for enhanced visual appeal.
- **UV Texture:** Preserve the UV mapping for accurate texturing.

## Challenges and Learning

Working on this project has been an enriching journey, involving overcoming various challenges. From optimizing performance to managing textures efficiently, every obstacle has contributed to a formative experience. This endeavor has deepened my understanding of the intricacies of both pixel art and 3D rendering. 🛠️🎓
